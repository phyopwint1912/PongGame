# PongGame

##Pong Game IOS App (Skylink SDK Version 1.0.9)

Pong is a two-dimensional sport game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it horizontally across the lower side of the screen, and can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth within different levels. The aim is for each player to reach five points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.

It can play by 2 devices as it has 2 players. Due to the real time playing game, data are sent simultaneously between devices by Skylink SDK which is based on WebRTC.
